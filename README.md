Physics:

- White Ball with cue
- White ball with the walls

- Cue direction
- Hitting the ball anywhere is like hitting it in the center

## How To Play

To choose where you want to hit the ball, move the mouse around.
When you are ready to shoot, left-click and drag the mouse to set the power of the shot. The further you drag, the more power you will have.

## How to win

The goal is to put all the balls in the pockets. The game ends when all the balls are potted. The player that potted the most balls wins.

## Rules

Two players take turns to shoot the white ball. If a player pots a ball, he can play again. If a player fails to pot a ball, the other player takes his turn.
If the white ball is potted, the other player can place it anywhere on the table.

## Installation

Download the executable and run it.
